# Another clean-themes for Logseq

My [Logseq](https://logseq.com) theme based on the work of @PiotrSss's [clean-themes](https://github.com/PiotrSss/logseq-clean-themes).

## Features

- Sticky side bar headers with blur effects
- CodeMirror theme
- Content Cards
- Vintage style query header tags
- and many small enhancements/tweaks

The easiest way to adopt this theme is to use jsDelivr CDN:

```css
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pengx17/logseq-clean-themes-alt@1.2.2/custom.css');
```
